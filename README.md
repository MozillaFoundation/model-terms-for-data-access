# Fairer Terms for Researcher Access to Data

At Mozilla Foundation, we believe privacy-protecting research is essential to understanding harmful data practices at scale.
This kind of access is foundational to maintaining trust—and to building better technology ecosystems.

Here's the problem: Online platforms typically set out contractual terms under which researchers are allowed to scrutinize them. 
Often, these terms actually hinder rigorous third party research, by preventing basic research practices—combining datasets, bringing new colleagues onto a project, submitting work for peer review, or publishing independently.

We decided to flip the script. We asked the data rights agency AWO to draft a prototype data sharing agreement which reflects user privacy and data security, and doesn't impose conditions that unnecessarily constrain research.
The result is a model contract that both platforms and researchers can adapt. We believe it centers the realities of public-interest platform research while respecting user privacy and legitimate business interests.

If you're a public interest platform researcher, here are model data-sharing terms you adapt and can use right now..




## Contributing
We welcome contributions from platform researchers, data privacy and security experts, online platforms, and others with relevant expertise.

2.  []{#_heading=h.qtmvjozh94c4 .anchor}**REQUESTS FOR AND PROVISION OF
    PUBLIC DATA FOR RESEARCH**

    1.  In the scope of this Agreement, the Platform shall provide the
        Researcher(s) with access to data which is publicly accessible
        in its online interface pursuant to Article 40(12) DSA in
        response to one or more **Public Data Requests**.

    2.  The Platform shall provide the Researcher(s) with such
        information about its data and systems as is reasonably required
        to formulate Public Data Requests.

    3.  A Public Data Request shall be submitted in writing and in the
        form set out in Annexes IA and B. Upon acceptance by the
        Platform, the content of a Public Data Request shall be
        incorporated into this Agreement.

    4.  Within twenty-one (21) days following receipt of a duly
        completed Public Data Request, the Platform shall either:

        1.  Accept the Public Data Request and provide the requested
            data;

        2.  If necessary to determine whether any of the grounds for
            refusal in clause 2.7 apply, request clarifications or
            additional information from the Researcher(s); or

        3.  Refuse to provide the data with reasons, if one of the
            grounds in clause 2.7 applies.

    5.  If the Platform fails to respond to a Public Data Request within
        21 days, the Request shall be deemed refused in breach of this
        Agreement.

    6.  Where possible, on acceptance of a Public Data Request, the
        Platform shall inform the Researcher of any volume or rate
        limits in Access Tools which will be necessary in the scope of
        the Research Project.

    7.  Permitted grounds for refusal by a Platform of a Public Data
        Request are limited to:

        1.  The requested data is not within the control of the Platform
            or, if it is, it is technically impossible to provide it in
            the form requested.

        2.  The Public Data Request and/or the research which it
            proposes are not consistent with Article 40(12) DSA.

        3.  The Platform is otherwise prevented from providing the
            requested data by applicable law or regulation.

    8.  If the platform refuses a Public Data Request, it shall identify
        the ground for refusal relied upon and explain in detail, in
        writing, and with specific application to the request in
        question, why the ground for refusal is made out.

3.  []{#_heading=h.9vyc2j92nia9 .anchor}**CHANGES TO RESEARCH**

    1.  If, following acceptance of a Public Data Request, the
        Researcher(s)' plans for the use of the Research Data materially
        change, the Researcher(s) shall submit an amended Public Data
        Request in the manner set out in Clause 2, with changes from the
        original request clearly indicated. That new request may be
        accepted or -- if a permitted ground for refusal is made out --
        refused, in which case the Researcher(s)' access to any data
        provided pursuant to the original request may be terminated by
        the Platform.

4.  **REPRESENTATIONS**

    1.  The Research Data will be shared pursuant to this Agreement for
        the purposes of the research project(s) described in each Public
        Data Request using the form set out in Annex IA (the "**Research
        Project(s)**").

    2.  Research Projects are expected to contribute to the detection,
        identification and understanding of systemic risks in the
        European Union pursuant to DSA Article 34(1).

    3.  The Researcher(s) represent that:

        1.  They are independent from commercial interests;

        2.  They are capable of fulfilling the data protection
            requirements applicable to the Public Data Request set out
            in Annex V;

        3.  The Research Data and the time frames requested in each
            Public Data Request are necessary for, and proportionate to,
            the purposes of the Research Project, and consistent with
            the principles of data minimisation and storage limitation;
            and

        4.  The expected results of the Research Project will contribute
            to the purposes of conducting research that contributes to
            the detection, identification and understanding of systemic
            risks in the European Union, as set out in DSA Article
            34(1), and to the assessment of the adequacy, efficiency and
            impacts of the risk mitigation measures pursuant to DSA
            Article 35.

    4.  The Platform represents that:

        1.  As far as it is aware, the Research Data is complete,
            accurate and up-to-date;

        2.  If the Research Data, in the Platform's knowledge, is
            inaccurate or outdated, the Platform will inform the
            Researcher(s) and identify the inaccurate or outdated data
            or time period in the dataset; and

        3.  The Research Data consists of all the data in its control
            that is specified in the Public Data Request, subject to any
            Quota under clause 5.4.1.

5.  **[MODES OF ACCESS AND ACCESS TOOLS]{.smallcaps}**

    1.  Access to Research Data shall be provided by the Platform to the
        Researcher(s) by means which are appropriately secure, such
        security being proportionate to the risks (if any) of sharing
        the Research Data for the purposes indicated in the Public Data
        Request. For the avoidance of doubt, provision of Research Data
        through a secure research environment or clean room shall not be
        a default requirement.

    2.  The Platform shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that
        Research Data made available under this Agreement is accurate
        and, where necessary, kept up to date. If the Platform becomes
        aware that data which has been shared or made available is
        inaccurate or outdated, it shall inform the Researcher(s).

    3.  Access shall be provided for the period of time set out in Annex
        IB, (the "**Access Period**") unless extended by written
        agreement.

    4.  Where the Platform provides access to Research Data through its
        own (or a third party's) data access tools ("**Access Tools**"),
        such Access Tools shall permit access to Research Data for
        Authorised Persons:

        1.  At a volume and rate which enables the Research Project to
            be carried out, save only for such volume or rate limits in
            Access Tools as are necessary to the cost efficient
            operation and integrity of the Platform's systems. Minimum
            volume and rate levels for Access Tools may be mutually
            agreed between the Parties and recorded in Annex IB (the
            "**Quota**").

        2.  Otherwise in a manner which renders the Research Project
            capable of being carried out without further approval by the
            Platform (including the ability to export and download raw
            data, access to relevant search operators and the ability to
            statistically analyse the data).

    5.  Researcher(s) use of Access Tools may be subject to additional
        terms and conditions that may be presented upon initial log-in
        or at any other time during use of the Tools where these are
        reasonably necessary for the protection of Personal Data, for
        maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and availability of
        the Research Data, or to protect the Platform's systems
        ("**Terms of Use**"). In the event of any conflict between the
        terms of this Agreement and the Terms of Use, the terms of this
        Agreement will prevail.

    6.  Nothing in this Agreement prevents the Researcher(s) from
        accessing data that is publicly accessible in the Platform's
        online interface via automated means such as data scraping.

    7.  The Researcher(s) shall remain accountable and responsible for
        all actions by the Authorised Personnel granted access to the
        Research Data and will ensure that Authorised Personnel comply
        with the requirements in this Agreement that are applicable to
        the Researcher(s) as if such Authorised Personnel were directly
        bound by this Agreement. In the event that a member of
        Authorised Personnel is no longer involved in the applicable
        Research Project or no longer requires access to the Research
        Data for any reason, the Researcher(s) will promptly notify the
        Platform and, if relevant, the Platform may terminate that
        person's access to the Research Data.

6.  []{#_heading=h.p6v0tbcr3rmf .anchor}**[USE OF RESEARCH
    DATA]{.smallcaps}**

> The Researcher(s) shall only use the Research Data for purposes
> reasonably related to the Research Project described in the related
> Public Data Request including but not limited to verification and
> replication of research results.

7.  **SHARING OF PERSONAL DATA**

    1.  Insofar as the Research Data includes Personal Data, the parties
        shall comply with Data Protection Legislation in relation to the
        sharing of Research Data and the subsequent processing of such
        Research Data. In particular, the Researcher(s) shall implement
        appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the
        security of any Personal Data, including protection against a
        personal data breach. In assessing the appropriate level of
        security, they shall take due account of the state of the art,
        the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and
        purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the
        processing for the data subject.

    2.  The parties are independent controllers for the purposes of the
        GDPR and UK GDPR, and each party is therefore responsible for
        its own compliance with the GDPR and UK GDPR.

8.  []{#_heading=h.75xaw4ou8gms .anchor}**[ONWARD SHARING of research
    data]{.smallcaps}**

    1.  The Researcher(s) may only share with third parties (other than
        competent authorities) all or part of the Research Data as
        required by law or under the following conditions:

        1.  The third party makes the representations in clauses 4.3.1
            and 4.3.2 to the Researcher(s) in writing;

        2.  The sharing is reasonably necessary for the Research Project
            including, but not limited to, verification and replication
            of research results; and

        3.  The Research Data (or part thereof) which has been shared is
            deleted by the third party once the purpose described in
            clause 8.1.2 is fulfilled.

    2.  Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Researcher(s) from
        sharing Research Data, including personal data, with Digital
        Services Coordinators or the European Commission, or other
        competent authority provided that this sharing has the purpose
        of assisting these authorities with the detection,
        identification and understanding of systemic risks in the Union,
        as set out pursuant to DSA Article 34(1), and to the assessment
        of the adequacy, efficiency and impacts of the risk mitigation
        measures pursuant to DSA Article 35, or as otherwise required by
        law.

    1.  The Researcher(s) agrees to use reasonable efforts to provide
        the Platform with a copy of each Research Publication at least
        seven (7) days before its publication. This timeframe may be
        extended, upon written agreement of the parties at the time of
        signing this Agreement or by subsequent amendment, if the nature
        of the Research Project or of the Research Data justifies an
        in-depth review, for the purposes of ensuring the protection of
        the rights and interests of Data Subjects, and/or protecting the
        Platform against serious and significant security threats.

    2.  The Platform will not have any editorial discretion or input in
        any Research Publication. In addition, the Platform will not
        have any intellectual property rights in or to be affiliated
        with or credited in any Research Output or Research Publication
        including, without limitation, any recommendations or
        conclusions included therein.

    3.  The Researcher(s) may reference the Platform as the source of
        the Research Data obtained. The Researcher(s) may not otherwise
        through its Research Outputs or Research Publications infringe
        any of the Platform's Intellectual Property Rights.

    4.  The Platform may not use or publish any Research Output or
        Research Publication without the Researcher(s)'s express, prior
        written permission, unless these are available under an open
        research framework.

10. []{#_heading=h.3i15d9s2a4jh .anchor}**[RECORD-KEEPING]{.smallcaps}**

    1.  The Researcher(s) shall maintain such records as are reasonably
        required to be able to demonstrate compliance with their
        obligations under this Agreement, including their obligation to
        process and Personal Data shared pursuant to it in compliance
        with the Data Protection Legislation.

    2.  Platforms may request sight of the records referred to in Clause
        10.1 insofar as strictly necessary to satisfy themselves of the
        Researcher(s) compliance with this Agreement where the Platform
        has reasonable grounds to suspect non-compliance, or otherwise
        to comply with their legal obligations.

11. **[RESTRICTED INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS]{.smallcaps}**

    1.  In the event of a Restricted Transfer from the Platform to the
        Researcher(s) or from the Researcher(s) to third parties (as
        permitted under clause 8.1), each Researcher and the Platform
        agree to comply with the obligations set out in the Standard
        Contractual Clauses (where such Restricted Transfer would be
        unlawful under Data Protection Legislation without such Standard
        Contractual Clauses being in place) as though they were set out
        in full in this Agreement with the data exporter and data
        importer as the parties and with the parties' signatures and
        dating of the Agreement being deemed to be the signature and
        dating of the Standard Contractual Clauses.

    2.  For the purposes of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses the
        following shall apply:

        1.  Clause 17 (Governing law): \[[insert]{.mark}\]; and

        2.  Clause 18 (Choice of forum and jurisdiction):
            \[[insert]{.mark}\]. *[\[Note: the governing law and
            jurisdiction here should be those in which the Researcher(s)

12. []{#_heading=h.pykpsyvjod0m .anchor}**LICENCE AND USE**

    1.  Without the prior written authorisation of the Platform, the
        Researcher(s) shall not sell, rent, or commercially exploit any
        Research Data, or any portion or derivative thereof (including
        any data models derived therefrom), to any third party for any
        purpose whatsoever, save as permitted by law.

    2.  To the extent any Data is disclosed in connection with this
        Agreement, upon the disclosure of such Data, the Platform grants
        a non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable licence to the
        Researcher(s) to use any Intellectual Property Rights subsisting
        in or related to the disclosed Data as is reasonably necessary
        for the Researcher(s) to achieve the specific aims of the
        Research Project as set out in Annex IA to exercise any rights
        or fulfil any obligations of the Researcher(s) under this
        Agreement. Each aforementioned licence shall terminate
        automatically upon the earlier of: (i) the end of the Access
        Period; or (ii) the Researcher(s) ceasing to be a party to this
        Agreement or upon the termination of the Researcher(s)'s rights
        under this Agreement.

13. []{#_heading=h.c4y6iw9p0i6m .anchor}**WARRANTIES**

**Mutual warranties**

1.  Each party (unless a natural person) represents, warrants and
    undertakes that it is duly incorporated and validly existing under
    the Laws of the jurisdiction of their registered office address.

2.  Each party represents, warrants and undertakes that it has the
    requisite power, right and authority to enter into and perform its
    obligations under this Agreement, and this Agreement, when executed,
    will constitute valid, lawful and binding obligations on it,
    enforceable in accordance with its terms.

**Exclusion of implied warranties**

3.  The express terms and conditions of this Agreement will apply in
    place of all warranties, conditions, terms, representations,
    statements, undertakings and obligations implied by statute, common
    law, custom, trade usage or otherwise (including implied
    undertakings of satisfactory quality and fitness for purpose), all
    of which are excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law.

14. []{#_heading=h.dcj0dfl3f9k6 .anchor}**CONFIDENTIALITY**

    1.  Each Receiving Party shall only use and disclose (including
        making copies of) Confidential Information in connection with
        and to the extent necessary for the purposes of this Agreement
        and in connection with and for the furtherance of Research
        Projects and as permitted by clauses 14.2 and 14.3.

    2.  The Receiving Party may disclose any Confidential Information to
        any regulator, law enforcement agency or other third party if it
        is required to do so by law, regulation, or similar authority.
        In those circumstances the Receiving Party shall (to the extent
        practical and lawful to do so) notify the relevant Disclosing
        Party in writing as soon as practicable before the disclosure
        and use all reasonable endeavours to consult with the relevant
        Disclosing Party with a view to agreeing the timing, manner and
        extent of the disclosure.

    3.  To the extent that any other provision of this Agreement
        contains restrictions or limitations on the processing of
        personal data which goes beyond clauses 14.1 or 14.2 then the
        relevant other provision of this Agreement shall prevail.

    4.  Each party acknowledges that damages alone would not be an
        adequate remedy in the event of breach by the other party of the
        provisions of this clause 14. Accordingly, it is agreed that any
        party shall be entitled, without proof of special damages, to
        seek an injunction or other interim remedy for any threatened or
        actual breach of this clause 14 by the other party, without
        prejudice to any other rights and remedies which that first
        party may have.

15. []{#_heading=h.v78g8nlzkx32 .anchor}**[LIMITATION OF

            authorise Platform to do this at its reasonable discretion.

17. []{#_heading=h.dmj2vy7zm42a .anchor}**[TERM and
    TERMINATION]{.smallcaps}**

        to the Research Data. The Researcher(s) shall then have
        seven (7) days from the Platform's notice to rectify the breach,
        after which the Platform will be entitled to suspend access to
        or require deletion of the Research Data shared with the
        Researcher(s).

    4.  The Platform shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement
        where:

            entirety. In case of local laws applicable to Recipient that
            prohibit the return or deletion of the Research Data, the
            Researcher(s) will continue to ensure compliance with this
            Agreement and will only use the Research Data to the extent
            and for as long as required under that local law;

        2.  Receiving Party shall return or destroy, and (in each case)
            make no further use of Disclosing Party\'s Confidential
